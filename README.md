# Supermarket Sales Analysis

This guided project was initially created by Bassim Eledath, ["Exploratory Data Analysis With Python and Pandas"](https://www.coursera.org/projects/exploratory-data-analysis-python-pandas), and it explores and analyzes the sales data of a supermarket chain recorded across three different branches over three months. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, product categories, sales amounts, and customer ratings. The primary objective is to perform initial data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis to uncover insights and patterns in the data.

## Context
